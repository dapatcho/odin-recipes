    <h1>Coffee, in a Hario Switch</h1>
    <h4>Every morning, I have a coffee. Maybe two if it's going to be a long day. Coffee, to me, is equal parts ritual and reward. It's a weird, specific, nerdy pursuit I have taken on, and I love sharing it with my friends whenever I can. I hope you brew something tasty.</h4>
